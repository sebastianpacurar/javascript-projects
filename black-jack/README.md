# This project is about Black Jack game of cards

#### How to Play
   
1) **Start Game** - set your game level (how many decks you wish to play with. a deck contains 52 cards)

2) **Play Game** - draw the 4 cards to start game (2 for you, and 2 for dealer)

3) **Hit** - get one card at a click
    * HINT: you should stop at 17. the game was designed to stop at this limit in order to have higher odds to win
4) **Stand** - after you consider it's ok to stop, the computer plays it's Hits

5) Hit **Play Game** to start a new game.

6) Refresh if you want to change deck

#### Rules of Black Jack:
* you need to get as high as possible to 21, but if you go over you went BUST (you lose)
* if you get higher points than the dealer, then you won. if dealer gets higher points, you lose
* ACE can be 1 or 11. based on the first 2 cards you get 11 points, after you get only 1 from each ACE
* J, K, Q and 10 are equal to 10 points. the other cards are valued to the number they have
* if you get a 10 or J, K, Q and an ACE at the beginning you already have 21 and dealer draws his cards

#### Side Notes:
* The API from where the AJAX fetches the cards is https://deckofcardsapi.com
* The project is in a basic form since I built it while I was learning the basics of js. Looking forward to update it
