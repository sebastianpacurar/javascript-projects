# Playing Cards Generator

#### This project is about a very basic fetch of data using fetch API

<br />

#### What you can do is:
* Generate 1 or more deck of cards (maximum allowed are 20 decks)
  * Negative numbers in input will be converted to 1
  * 0 as input will be converted to 1 deck or card

* Draw 1 or more cards (out of bounds numbers will simply draw all cards in the decks)
* Reshuffle the deck (removes all cards displayed)
* Track down remaining cards number and decks 

<br />

#### Side notes:
* The API from where the cards are fetched  is https://deckofcardsapi.com
