# This project is about a shopping list

#### What you can do is:
* add an item to shopping list
* remove an item from shopping list
* buy an item (move to bought items)
* remove item from bought items

<br />

#### Side notes:
* for the product with the same name, the quantity will be incremented, and the price will be the sum between the first item and second item
* if no price specified there will be one generated between 1.00 and 20.00
* if there are a lot of items in the list, the list can be scrolled / swiped
* if there are a lot of bought items in the table, the table can be scrolled / swiped
